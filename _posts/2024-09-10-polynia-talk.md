## Abstract

The sea ice formation and accompanied High Salinity Shelf water creation in the Terra Nova Bay polynya are
studied using an 8-year long hydrographic mooring timeseries near the Drygalski Ice Tongue and a Terra Nova
Bay MITgcm model. In this talk I present some preliminary results of the observations and the set-up of the
model.
