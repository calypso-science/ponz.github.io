# Graduate Research

<p class="message">
  I earned my Masters in Software Engineering and PhD in Computer Science at Kansas State University doing research in software architectures for complex, distributed systems.  
  It combined my interests in natural and artificial intelligence and my dissertation introduces a flexible, reusable architecture for building systems of intelligent systems.

## Holonic Multiagent Control of Intelligent Power Distribution Systems

This NSF-funded research was conducted as an interdisciplinary project with the department of Electrical and Computer Engineering. We designed and demonstrated a Holonic Multiagent System Architecture capable of adaptively controlling future electrical power distribution systems (PDS) with a large number of renewable power generators, energy storage devices, and advanced metering and control devices. The project resulted in a general, extensible, and secure cyber architecture based on holonic multiagent principles to support adaptive PDS.

[13th International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (AAMAS 2014)](http://aamas2014.lip6.fr/)

[12th International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (AAMAS 2013)](http://aamas2013.cs.umn.edu/)

AAMAS is the leading scientific conference for research in autonomous agents and multiagent systems. The AAMAS conference series was initiated in 2002 by merging three highly respected meetings: the International Conference on Multi-Agent Systems (ICMAS); the International Workshop on Agent Theories, Architectures, and Languages (ATAL); and the International Conference on Autonomous Agents (AA). The aim of the joint conference is to provide a single, high-profile, internationally respected archival forum for scientific research in the theory and practice of autonomous agents and multiagent systems.

[1st International Workshop on Engineering Multi-Agent Systems (EMAS 2013)](http://emas2013.otago.ac.nz/)

The international workshop on Engineering Multi-Agent Systems (EMAS 2014) focuses on both foundations and applications of the engineering of multi-agent systems. EMAS was formed in 2013 as a merger of three existing workshops with a long-lasting tradition with the AAMAS conference: Agent Oriented Software Engineering (AOSE), Declarative Agent Languages and Technologies (DALT), and Programming Multiagent Systems (ProMAS). The workshop will be held on 5-6 May (two days) in conjunction with AAMAS 2014, in Paris, France. The workshop post-proceedings will be published by Springer in the LNAI series.

## Alaskan Shorebird Microbiota Phylogenetic Study

As part of the Alaskan shore bird microbiota bioinformatics project at Kansas State University, avian fecal samples were collected from nine sites along the Alaskan shore and Canada.The project was conducted as part of a research study focusing on the evolving diversity of bird gut microbes. See ["The Scoop on Bird Poop"](http://phys.org/news/2013-05-scoop-bird-poop-evolving-diversity.html).

[A Shore Bird Microbiota Project site](http://ksucase.github.io/bird_microbiota) was created to review sample distributions from the site locations. The site includes Alaska GINA GIS site information and uses [D3](http://d3js.org/) for data visualization.
